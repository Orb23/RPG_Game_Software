In order to update to the latest version.
Delete all contents inside your assets folder.

Then:
  Drag asset_version_###.unitypackage into your empty asset folder.
  If prompted to import TMP mesh template, ignore it. The Asset package already has its own template.
  
  Be sure to have the build scene's in the correct order:
    1. Menu
    2. Map
    3. BattleScene
    
    To add scenes to build:
      File > Build Settings > Drag scenes into "Scenes in Build".  THEN EXIT.
      Note: clicking on build or build and run will create an exe program. This is not needed when testing scene switches.
        Only build if you want to see what the client's will see when they run the exe application.
  
  
  TO UPLOAD YOUR asset_version_###.unitypackage:
    Right click "Assets" folder > Export Package > Export (be sure that include dependencies is checked) > save asset_version_###.unitypackage.
    Upload asset_version_###.unitypackage to test branch.
